          This API hook returns infos about the networking routes of your Pi-hole. Note that not all described fields are applicable to any routing type. Users must not rely on the presence of any field without checking the route type first.

          If the optional parameter `detailed` is set to `true`, the response will include more detailed information about the individual routes where the available information is dependent on the route type and state.
