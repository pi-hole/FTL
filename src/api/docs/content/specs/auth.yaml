          Authenticate using a password. The password isn't stored in the session nor used to create the session token. Instead, the session token is produced using a cryptographically secure random number generator. A CSRF token is utilized to guard against CSRF attacks and is necessary when using Cookie-based authentication. However, it's not needed with other authentication methods.

          Both the Session ID (SID) and CSRF token remain valid for the session's duration. The session can be extended before its expiration by performing any authenticated action. By default, the session lasts for 5 minutes. It can be invalidated by either logging out or deleting the session. Additionally, the session becomes invalid when the password is altered or a new application password is created.

          If two-factor authentication (2FA) is activated, the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) token must be included in the request body. Be aware that the TOTP token, generated by your authenticator app, is only valid for 30 seconds. If the TOTP token is missing, invalid, or has been used previously, the login attempt will be unsuccessful.

          This endpoint can be used to delete the current session. It will
          invalidate the session token and the CSRF token. The session can be
          extended before its expiration by performing any authenticated action.
          By default, the session lasts for 5 minutes. It can be invalidated by
          either logging out or deleting the session. Additionally, the session
          becomes invalid when the password is altered or a new application
          password is created.

          You can also delete a session by its ID using the `DELETE /auth/session/{id}` endpoint.

          Note that you cannot delete the current session if you have not
          authenticated (e.g., no password has been set on your Pi-hole).

          Create a new application password. The generated password is shown only once and cannot be retrieved later - make sure to store it in a safe place. The application password can be used to authenticate against the API instead of the regular password.
          It does not require 2FA verification. Generating a new application password will invalidate all currently active sessions.

          Note that this endpoint only generates an application password accompanied by its hash. To make this new password effective, the returned `hash` has to be set as `webserver.api.app_password` in the Pi-hole configuration in a follow-up step. This can be done in various ways, e.g. via the API (`PATCH /api/config/webserver/api/app_pwhash`), the graphical web interface (Settings -> All Settings) or by editing the configuration file directly.
