# Both the definition of environment variables and checking out the code
# needs to be done outside of the composite action as
# - environment variables cannot be defined using inputs
# - the checkout action needs to be the first step in the workflow, otherwise we
#   cannot use the composite action as the corresponding "action.yml" isn't
#   there yet
