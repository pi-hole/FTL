FTLDNS[™](https://pi-hole.net/trademark-rules-and-brand-guidelines/) (`pihole-FTL`) provides an interactive API and also generates statistics for Pi-hole[®](https://pi-hole.net/trademark-rules-and-brand-guidelines/)'s Web interface.

- **Fast**: stats are read directly from memory by coupling our codebase closely with `dnsmasq`
- **Versatile**: upstream changes to `dnsmasq` can quickly be merged in without much conflict
- **Lightweight**: runs smoothly with [minimal hardware and software requirements](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/hardware-software-requirements/273) such as Raspberry Pi Zero
- **Interactive**: our API can be used to interface with your projects
- **Insightful**: stats normally reserved inside of `dnsmasq` are made available so you can see what's really happening on your network

# Official documentation

The official *FTL*DNS documentation can be found [here](https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/).

# Installation

FTLDNS (`pihole-FTL`) is installed by default when you choose to enable the Web interface when installing Pi-hole.

> IMPORTANT!

>FTLDNS will _disable_ any existing installations of `dnsmasq`.  This is because FTLDNS _is_ `dnsmasq` + Pi-hole's code, so both cannot run simultaneously.

## Post-install: Gain insight into your network's activity

As mentioned earlier, FTLDNS will be enabled by default when you install Pi-hole.  To access the Web interface, navigate to `http://pi.hole/admin` or `http://<IP OF YOUR PIHOLE>/admin`.

Once logged in, (or authenticated to the API) you can view your network stats to see things like:

- the domains being queried on your network
- the time the queries were initiated
- the amount of domains that were blocked
- the upstream server queries were sent to
- the type of queries (`A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `SRV`, `TXT`, etc.)

## Pi-hole is free, but powered by your support
There are many reoccurring costs involved with maintaining free, open source, and privacy respecting software; expenses which [our volunteer developers](https://github.com/orgs/pi-hole/people) pitch in to cover out-of-pocket. This is just one example of how strongly we feel about our software, as well as the importance of keeping it maintained.

Make no mistake: **your support is absolutely vital to help keep us innovating!**
