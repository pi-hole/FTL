### How to test FTL?

`FTL` is now part of the Pi-hole `development` branches.
If you want to test it, use `pihole checkout dev`

### How to compile FTL from source?

1. Clone the repo
2. `make`
3. `sudo make install`
4. `sudo service pihole-FTL start`

### Debugging `pihole-FTL`

#### Debugging instructions (when `FTL` is not starting reliably)

Once you are used to it, you can skip most of the steps and debugging is actually quite easy and gives you insights into how software (not limited to `pihole-FTL`) works.

1. Install `screen` and `gdb` (probably `sudo apt-get install screen gdb`)
2. Start a screen session (it will allow you to come back even if the SSH connection died)
  * If you don't know about `screen`, then read about it (you *will* love it!)
3. Start a screen session using `screen`
4. Ensure that `pihole-FTL` is terminated (e.g. `sudo killall pihole-FTL`)
5. Arrange file permissions to be able to start `FTL` as your current user (the following assumes you are logged in as user `pi`).
  * `sudo touch /var/log/pihole-FTL.log /run/pihole-FTL.pid /run/pihole-FTL.port`
  * `sudo chown pi:pi /var/log/pihole-FTL.log /run/pihole-FTL.pid /run/pihole-FTL.port`
  * `sudo chmod 0644 /var/log/pihole-FTL.log /run/pihole-FTL.pid /run/pihole-FTL.port`
6. Start `pihole-FTL` in the debugger: `gdb pihole-FTL`
7. Type `handle SIGHUP nostop SIGPIPE nostop` to instruct the debugger to don't stop on expected signals
8. Type `run debug` to start `FTL` (you should see some lines of text and `FTL` should start successfully)
9. You can now close the terminal (Ctrl+A and then D to detach) and come back later using (`screen -r`) when it has crashed
10. If it has crashed, copy&paste the terminal output, and
11. type also `backtrace` and post the output in a (new) issue
12. We might ask for additional information in order to isolate your particular issue

#### Simplified debugging instructions (when `FTL` is running)

`FTL` has been designed such that a debugger can be attached to an already running process to ease debugging. Use `sudo gdb -p $(pidof pihole-FTL)` to attach to an already running `pihole-FTL` process. You can leave off `sudo` if you are running `pihole-FTL` with the current user. Once loading of the symbols has finished (the `(gdb)` input prompt is shown), run `handle SIGHUP nostop SIGPIPE nostop` followed by `continue` to continue operation of `pihole-FTL` inside the debugger. All debugger features are now available.

If `pihole-FTL` has crashed, copy&paste the terminal output into a (new) issue. Also type `backtrace` and include its output. We might ask for additional information in order to isolate your particular issue.

When you want to detach the debugger from `FTL` without terminating the process, you can hit `Ctrl+C` and enter `detach` followed by `quit`.

### Command line arguments

- `debug` - Don't go into daemon mode (stay in foreground) + more verbose logging
- `test` - Start `FTL` and process everything, but shut down immediately afterwards
- `version` - Don't start `FTL`, show only version
- `tag` - Don't start `FTL`, show only git tag
- `branch` - Don't start `FTL`, show only git branch `FTL` was compiled from
- `no-daemon` or `-f` - Don't go into background (daemon mode)
- `help` or `-h` - Don't start `FTL`, show help

Command line arguments can be arbitrarily combined, e.g. `pihole-FTL debug test`

### File locations
- `/var/log/pihole-FTL.log` log file
- `/var/run/pihole-FTL.pid` PID file
- `/var/run/pihole-FTL.port` file containing port on which `FTL` is listening

### Socket connections

connect via e.g. `telnet 127.0.0.1 4711`
port may be automatically incremented if `4711` isn't available

### FTL's config file

You can create a file `/etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.conf` that will be read by `FTL` on startup.

Possible settings (**the option shown first is the default**):

- `SOCKET_LISTENING=localonly|all` (Listen only for local socket connections or permit all connections)
- `TIMEFRAME=rolling24h|yesterday|today` (Rolling data window, up to 48h (today + yesterday), or up to 24h (only today, as in Pi-hole `v2.x` ))
- `QUERY_DISPLAY=yes|no` (Display all queries? Set to `no` to hide query display)
- `AAAA_QUERY_ANALYSIS=yes|no` (Allow `FTL` to analyze AAAA queries from pihole.log?)
- `MAXDBDAYS=365` (How long should queries be stored in the database? Setting this to `0` disables the database altogether)
- `RESOLVE_IPV6=yes|no` (Should `FTL` try to resolve IPv6 addresses to host names?)
- `RESOLVE_IPV4=yes|no` (Should `FTL` try to resolve IPv4 addresses to host names?)

### Implemented keywords (starting with `>`, subject to change):

- `>quit`: Closes connection to client

- `>kill`: Terminates FTL
