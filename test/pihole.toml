  #       exists on the server. It is intended to be set as a default on installation,
  #       to allow unconfigured installations to be useful but also safe from being used
  #       for DNS amplification attacks if (accidentally) running public.
  #   - "SINGLE"
  #       Permit all origins, accept only on the specified interface. Respond only to
  #       queries arriving on the specified interface. The loopback (lo) interface is

  #       Make sure your Pi-hole is properly firewalled!
  #   - "BIND"
  #       By default, FTL binds the wildcard address. If this is not what you want, you
  #       can use this option as it forces FTL to really bind only the interfaces it is
  #       listening on. Note that this may result in issues when the interface may go
  #       down (cable unplugged, etc.). About the only time when this is useful is when
  #       running another nameserver on the same port on the same machine. This may also

    # use FTL while rate-limited clients are short-circuited at the same time.
    # For this setting, both numbers, the maximum number of queries within a given time,
    # and the length of the time interval (seconds) have to be specified. For instance, if
    # you want to set a rate limit of 1 query per hour, the option should look like
    # RATE_LIMIT=1/3600. The time interval is relative to when FTL has finished starting
    # (start of the daemon + possible delay by DELAY_STARTUP) then it will advance in
    # steps of the rate-limiting interval. If a client reaches the maximum number of
    # queries it will be blocked until the end of the current interval. This will be
    # logged to /var/log/pihole/FTL.log, e.g. Rate-limiting 10.0.1.39 for at least 44

  # specified as well, e.g. "[::1]:8080" for the IPv6 loopback interface. [::]:80 will

  # work as expected, so you have to test to find the configuration most suitable for
  # your needs. In case "+8080" does not work for your environment, you need to use
  # "8080,[::]:8080".
  # If the port is TLS/SSL, a letter 's' must be appended, for example, "8080,443s" will
  # open port 8080 and port 443, and connections on port 443 will be encrypted. For

  # redirected to HTTPS port 443.
