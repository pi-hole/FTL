  # Should _esni. subdomains be blocked by default? Encrypted Server Name Indication
  # (ESNI) is certainly a good step into the right direction to enhance privacy on the

  # firewalls, from intercepting the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) extension by
  # encrypting it. This prevents the SNI from being used to determine which websites
  # users are visiting.
  #
  # ESNI will obviously cause issues for pixelserv-tls which will be unable to generate
  # matching certificates on-the-fly when it cannot read the SNI. Cloudflare and Firefox
  # are already enabling ESNI. According to the IETF draft (link above), we can easily

  #   - "HOSTNAME"
  #       Serve the machine's hostname. The hostname is queried from the kernel through
  #       uname(2)->nodename. If the machine has multiple network interfaces, it can
  #       also have multiple nodenames. In this case, it is unspecified and up to the
  #       kernel which one will be returned. On Linux, the returned string is what has
  #       been set using sethostname(2) which is typically what has been set in
  #       /etc/hostname.

  #       Serve the machine's hostname (see limitations above) as fully qualified domain
  #       by adding the local domain. If no local domain has been defined (config option
  #       dns.domain.name), FTL tries to query the domain name from the kernel using

  #       Allow only local requests. This setting accepts DNS queries only from hosts
  #       whose address is on a local subnet, i.e., a subnet for which an interface
  #       exists on the server. It is intended to be set as a default on installation,
  #       to allow unconfigured installations to be useful but also safe from being used
  #       for DNS amplification attacks if (accidentally) running public.
  #   - "SINGLE"
  #       Permit all origins, accept only on the specified interface. Respond only to
  #       queries arriving on the specified interface. The loopback (lo) interface is
  #       automatically added to the list of interfaces to use when this option is used.
  #       Make sure your Pi-hole is properly firewalled!
  #   - "BIND"
  #       By default, FTL binds the wildcard address. If this is not what you want, you
  #       can use this option as it forces FTL to really bind only the interfaces it is
  #       listening on. Note that this may result in issues when the interface may go
  #       down (cable unplugged, etc.). About the only time when this is useful is when
  #       running another nameserver on the same port on the same machine. This may also
  #       happen if you run a virtualization API such as libvirt. When this option is
  #       used, IP alias interface labels (e.g. enp2s0:0) are checked rather than
  #       interface names.
  #   - "ALL"
  #       Permit all origins, accept on all interfaces. Make sure your Pi-hole is
  #       properly firewalled! This truly allows any traffic to be replied to and is a
  #       dangerous thing to do as your Pi-hole could become an open resolver. You
  #       should always ask yourself if the first option doesn't work for you as well.
  #   - "NONE"
  #       Do not add any configuration concerning the listening mode to the dnsmasq
  #       configuration file. This is useful if you want to manually configure the
  #       listening mode in auxiliary configuration files. This option is really meant

  # will only show IP addresses.
  #
  # One solution for this is to configure Pi-hole to forward these requests to your DHCP
  # server (most likely your router), but only for devices on your home network. To
  # configure this we will need to know the IP address of your DHCP server and which
  # addresses belong to your local network.

  [dns.domain]
    # The DNS domain used by your Pi-hole.
    #
    # This DNS domain is purely local. FTL may answer queries from its local cache and
    # configuration but *never* forwards any requests upstream *unless* you have
    # configured a dns.revServer exactly for this domain. In the latter case, all queries
    # for this domain are sent exclusively to this server (including reverse lookups).
    #
    # For DHCP, this has two effects; firstly it causes the DHCP server to return the
    # domain to any hosts which request it, and secondly it sets the domain which it is
    # legal for DHCP-configured hosts to claim. The intention is to constrain hostnames so
    # that an untrusted host on the LAN cannot advertise its name via DHCP as e.g.
    # "google.com" and capture traffic not meant for it. If no domain suffix is specified,
    # then any DHCP hostname with a domain part (ie with a period) will be disallowed and
    # logged. If a domain is specified, then hostnames with a domain part are allowed,
    # provided the domain part matches the suffix. In addition, when a suffix is set then
    # hostnames without a domain part have the suffix added as an optional domain part.
    # For instance, we can set domain=mylab.com and have a machine whose DHCP hostname is
    # "laptop". The IP address for that machine is available both as "laptop" and
    # "laptop.mylab.com".

    # this domain.
    #
    # If unset, queries for this domain are forwarded upstream to (possibly public) server
    # which is probably not what you want *unless* you have added extra configuration for

    # expired only recently, the data will be used anyway (a refreshing from upstream is

    # connections. This feature comes at the expense of possibly sometimes returning
    # out-of-date data and less efficient cache utilization, since old data cannot be
    # flushed when its TTL expires, so the cache becomes mostly least-recently-used. To
    # mitigate issues caused by massively outdated DNS replies, the maximum overaging of
    # cached records is limited. We strongly recommend staying below 86400 (1 day) with
    # this option.
    #
    # Setting the TTL excess time to zero will serve stale cache data regardless how long

    # in 60 seconds. Both numbers can be customized independently. It is important to note
    # that rate-limiting is happening on a per-client basis. Other clients can continue to
    # use FTL while rate-limited clients are short-circuited at the same time.
    #
    # For this setting, both numbers, the maximum number of queries within a given time,
    # and the length of the time interval (seconds) have to be specified. For instance, if
    # you want to set a rate limit of 1 query per hour, the option should look like
    # dns.rateLimit.count=1 and dns.rateLimit.interval=3600. The time interval is relative
    # to when FTL has finished starting (start of the daemon + possible delay by
    # DELAY_STARTUP) then it will advance in steps of the rate-limiting interval. If a
    # client reaches the maximum number of queries it will be blocked until the end of the
    # current interval. This will be logged to /var/log/pihole/FTL.log, e.g. Rate-limiting
    # 10.0.1.39 for at least 44 seconds. If the client continues to send queries while
    # being blocked already and this number of queries during the blocking exceeds the
    # limit the client will continue to be blocked until the end of the next interval
    # (FTL.log will contain lines like Still rate-limiting 10.0.1.39 as it made additional
    # 5007 queries). As soon as the client requests less than the set limit, it will be
    # unblocked (Ending rate-limitation of 10.0.1.39).

  # Ports to be used by the webserver.
  #
  # Comma-separated list of ports to listen on. It is possible to specify an IP address
  # to bind to. In this case, an IP address and a colon must be prepended to the port
  # number. For example, to bind to the loopback interface on port 80 (IPv4) and to all
  # interfaces port 8080 (IPv4), use "127.0.0.1:80,8080". "[::]:80" can be used to
  # listen to IPv6 connections to port 80. IPv6 addresses of network interfaces can be
  # specified as well, e.g. "[::1]:80" for the IPv6 loopback interface. "[::]:80" will
  # bind to port 80 IPv6 only.
  #
  # In order to use port 80 for all interfaces, both IPv4 and IPv6, use either the
  # configuration "80,[::]:80" (create one socket for IPv4 and one for IPv6 only), or
  # "+80" (create one socket for both, IPv4 and IPv6). The '+' notation to use IPv4 and
  # IPv6 will only work if no network interface is specified. Depending on your
  # operating system version and IPv6 network environment, some configurations might not
  # work as expected, so you have to test to find the configuration most suitable for
  # your needs. In case "+80" does not work for your environment, you need to use
  # "80,[::]:80".
  #
  # If the port is TLS/SSL, a letter 's' (secure) must be appended, for example,
  # "80,443s" will open port 80 and port 443, and connections on port 443 will be
  # encrypted. For non-encrypted ports, it is allowed to append letter 'r' (as in
  # redirect). Redirected ports will redirect all their traffic to the first configured
  # SSL port. For example, if webserver.port is "80r,443s", then all HTTP traffic coming
  # at port 80 will be redirected to HTTPS port 443.
  #
  # When specifying 'o' (optional) behind a port, inability to use this port is not
  # considered an error. For instance, specifying "80o,8080o" will allow the webserver
  # to listen on either 80, 8080, both or even none of the two ports. This flag may be
  # combined with 'r' and 's' like "80or,443os,8080,4443s" (80 redirecting to SSL if
  # available, 443 encrypted if available, 8080 mandatory and unencrypted, 4443
  # mandatory and encrypted).

  # If this value is not set (empty string), the web server will not be started and,
  # hence, the API will not be available.

  # code.
  # - X-Frame-Options: DENY: The page can not be displayed in a frame, regardless of the

  # - X-Xss-Protection: 0: Disables XSS filtering in browsers that support it. This
  # header is usually enabled by default in browsers, and is not recommended as it can
  # hurt the security of the site.
  # (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection).
  # - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff: Marker used by the server to indicate that the

  # followed. This allows to opt-out of MIME type sniffing, or, in other words, it is a
  # way to say that the webmasters knew what they were doing. Site security testers
  # usually expect this header to be set.
