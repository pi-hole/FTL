  # Webserver access control list (ACL) allowing for restrictions to be put on the list
  # of IP addresses which have access to the web server. The ACL is a comma separated
  # list of IP subnets, where each subnet is prepended by either a - or a + sign. A plus
  # sign means allow, where a minus sign means deny. If a subnet mask is omitted, such
  # as -1.2.3.4, this means to deny only that single IP address. If this value is not
  # set (empty string), all accesses are allowed. Otherwise, the default setting is to
  # deny all accesses. On each request the full list is traversed, and the last (!)
  # match wins. IPv6 addresses may be specified in CIDR-form [a:b::c]/64.
  #
  # Example 1: acl = "+127.0.0.1,+[::1]"
  # ---> deny all access, except from 127.0.0.1 and ::1,
  # Example 2: acl = "+192.168.0.0/16"
  # ---> deny all accesses, except from the 192.168.0.0/16 subnet,
  # Example 3: acl = "+[::]/0" ---> allow only IPv6 access.

  # Possible values are:
  #     <valid ACL>
  acl = ""

  # Ports to be used by the webserver.
  # Comma-separated list of ports to listen on. It is possible to specify an IP address
  # to bind to. In this case, an IP address and a colon must be prepended to the port
  # number. For example, to bind to the loopback interface on port 80 (IPv4) and to all
  # interfaces port 8080 (IPv4), use "127.0.0.1:80,8080". "[::]:80" can be used to
  # listen to IPv6 connections to port 80. IPv6 addresses of network interfaces can be
  # specified as well, e.g. "[::1]:80" for the IPv6 loopback interface. [::]:80 will
  # bind to port 80 IPv6 only.
  # In order to use port 80 for all interfaces, both IPv4 and IPv6, use either the
  # configuration "80,[::]:80" (create one socket for IPv4 and one for IPv6 only), or
  # "+80" (create one socket for both, IPv4 and IPv6). The + notation to use IPv4 and
  # IPv6 will only work if no network interface is specified. Depending on your
  # operating system version and IPv6 network environment, some configurations might not
  # work as expected, so you have to test to find the configuration most suitable for
  # your needs. In case "+80" does not work for your environment, you need to use
  # "80,[::]:80".
  # If the port is TLS/SSL, a letter 's' must be appended, for example, "80,443s" will
  # open port 80 and port 443, and connections on port 443 will be encrypted. For
  # non-encrypted ports, it is allowed to append letter 'r' (as in redirect). Redirected
  # ports will redirect all their traffic to the first configured SSL port. For example,
  # if webserver.port is "80r,443s", then all HTTP traffic coming at port 80 will be
  # redirected to HTTPS port 443. If this value is not set (empty string), the web
  # server will not be started and, hence, the API will not be available.
